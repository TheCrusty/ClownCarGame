	\-world has a list of clowns, get them all and logs that you win.
	\-world has a timer that if it gets to zero you lose.	
	\- UI shows remaining time and clowns.
	3D world has buildings you have to drive around.
	UI arrow that points at nearest clowns.	
	Menu that popups up when you win or lose.
   	    functions that make them different if you win or lose.


Physics Game
	Create a 2d area that is red, when you drag the 'clown' into the 2d area it turns green.
	Now partially fill the 2d area with other 'clowns'. 
	Now make the clown have physics arms and legs.
	Add a button that only allows you to click it when the 2d area is green.
	Add a function that spawns another close outside of the 2d area.
